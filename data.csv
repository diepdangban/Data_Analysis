Commit,433e9aef61db2616dd0521a84bca029363b2085b,"Enhancement of validation.

Many data structure in Fishtest contain references to a run
objects. Naively validating such data structures means that we
are also validating the embedded run objects, which is wasteful
as these are already validated elsewhere.

The latest version of vtjson makes it possible to change
subschemas during validation.

In this PR we define the cache_schema as

cache_schema = {
    run_id: {
        ""run"": set_label(runs_schema, ""runs_schema""),
	""is_changed"": bool,
        ""last_sync_time"": ufloat,
        ""last_access_time"": ufloat,

Also: some code refactoring. The functions with name

Also: we have updated the cache_schema as the field

A dead task (a task which has not been updated for 360s) will only
be scavenged if it belongs to a run in the cache. However clean
runs are evicted from the cache after 300s. So if the run does
not get new tasks, for example because it has low priority, the
dead tasks remain unscavenged until somebody explicitly looks at
the run (this pulls the run back in the cache).

Tested working fine with a fleet of 75k cores 10k machines,
Waitress configured with threads=4 and connection_limit=100
HW usage: RAM 72%, primary Waitress instance CPU 85-95%

This is a good compromise for threads ""privileged"" for ""request_task"" API,
and threads free for any other APIs, while keeping Waitress threads=4.

Raising the number of Waitress threads uses more RAM and can
requires lowering the MongoDB cache size to avoid the OOM killer.

By using this token, you can surpass the standard rate limit, extending it beyond the 5000 requests per hour limit. You can find more information about GitHub's rate limits here.

It's important to note that this token will not be stored in a database but rather in your local storage. This ensures security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

The token should only be granted read-only permissions and limited access. This ensures that it can only be used for viewing content and not for making any modifications or accessing sensitive information.

Instructions:
1- Access the link here.
2- Generate a new token.
3- Set the Repository access to ""All Repositories"".
4- In the Permissions section, grant only the ""Read"" permission for contents, leaving all other permissions as ""No Access"".

This commit adds a feature that streams PGNs of a run, significantly reducing
the server's CPU/RAM usage. The API now returns a gzipped PGN, constructed by
chaining all the run's gzipped PGNs, which is streamed to the client.

Key changes:
1. update 'api_download_run_pgns' in api.py, which handles the request for
downloading the PGN of the run. It fetches the PGNs using the
'get_run_pgns' method from the RunDb class, and returns a gzipped response
   ```
   wget https://test.stockfishchess.org/api/run_pgns/<run_id>.pgn.gz
   ```
2. add 'GeneratorAsFileReader' class in util.py that provides a file-like
interface for a generator, enabling chanked reading
3. modify the 'get_run_pgns' method in rundb.py to return a
'GeneratorAsFileReader' object that yields each gzipped PGN file for the run

Note: the `gunzip on;` directive must be removed from the nginx configuration.

worker errors which happen before a task is requested (e.g.

Commit,f8b9c2863f69b881d6a513b841a60846fcab2a60,"Tighten up the schema in api.py.

The api's in api.py are a direct connection between the workers
and the db. So it makes sense to be very strict in what we accept.

Note: a serious bug was discovered in the handling of optional keys in
vtjson. So vtjson should be upgraded to the latest version. Since
upgrading is necessary anyway, this PR depends on a previously
internal feature of vtjson, namely the possibility to pre-compile
a schema.

Validation is done after the creation of runs and before writing
finished runs to disk. If a finished run fails validation then
this is logged but the run is otherwise treated normally.

No attempt has been made to make the schema as tight as possible.
For example most numbers should be positive but this constraint
is ignored by the schema. The main purpose of the schema is to
document the structure of the rundb. The reason it is also used
for validation in some cases is to ensure that if the
structure of the rundb changes then the schema is updated to
reflect this change.

For a description of the schema format see the README.md file
of https://github.com/vdbergh/vtjson

Commit,d249d09835e24b8a035c8f77681cd6adaac7c22a,"Implement efficient PGN upload and bulk download

The previous worker code posted the PGN to the server in a
zlib-compressed format. This required the server to decompress
the data before serving the PGN as text, resulting in significant CPU
and network overhead. Furthermore, a bulk download of all PGNs from a run
necessitated additional CPU overhead for compression.

The updated worker code posts a gzip file containing the PGN text
to the server, leading to more efficient handling on the server side:
- for single PGN downloads, the server simply serves
  the gzipped PGN retrieved from MongoDB. All modern browsers
  decompress the gzip file client side, so the user will get the
  pgn as text file. nginx can be configured to decompress on the fly
  the gzip content for a client that is not declaring his compression
  capability.
- for bulk PGN downloads, the server writes a tar file
  containing all the gzipped PGNs retrieved from MongoDB
  ```
  wget https://test.stockfishchess.org/api/run_pgns/<run_id>.pgns.tar
  ```
- gzip module uses zlib, no change for the compression ratio.

as the user could change the compiler at worker startup time (e.g. clang vs gcc),
the binary cache might contain binaries compiled with a different compiler
than the ones generated by the worker. As different compilers lead to binaries of
different speed, test results could be biased, unless we assure that the same compiler
is used for both base and new test.

This patch just clears the binary cache once at worker startup,
leaving the caching mechanism unchanged otherwise.

Commit,9a8a5c8d8593c538a9edf5ed98d5a5d95936bbd0,"Standardize usage of ""last_updated"" name

In the codebase, the key ""last_updated"" is consistently used as
a datetime object. However, in ""delta_update_users.py"",
it was used as a string representation.

This change standardizes the usage of ""last_updated"" by ensuring that
it is always used as a datetime object. As a result, it is necessary
to run ""delta_update_users.py"" in full scan mode to rebuild the
""users_cache"" and ""top_month"" collections with the new key names.",,ppigazzini,2023-05-27 16:10:44,,"server/fishtest/templates/users.mak,server/utils/delta_update_users.py",,,,,True
Commit,baf03695c060d0dfed907254b5b8bfa61fdaa960,"Rewrite ""delta_update_users.py""

The previous version of the script had two major issues:
1. it loaded only one run ID from the deltas collection without any sorting
   criterion. Since there is no guarantee that the returned natural order
   is the insertion order, this could result in a very inaccurate contribution
   calculation in the first update scan after a full scan, when the deltas
   collection contains all the finished run IDs.
2. the run, with the ID loaded from the deltas collection, could switch
   to active status (e.g., after a purge).
   This resulted in failing to stop the processing and double counting
   of already processed finished runs from the last 30 days.

Changes:
- load and save the IDs of all the processed finished runs in
  deltas collection, python checks if a key is in a dict in O(1)
- in update scan mode, for the total contribution:
  - skip processing of any finished run with ID in deltas
  - stop processing after hitting 10 finished runs with ID in deltas
- lazy load the data from collections to lower the RAM footprint
- simplify the algorithms
- add comments

Note that the update scan is not perfect:
- it does not account for the additional contribution of runs that have
  switched from finished to unfinished and back to finished in the meantime.
- it underestimates the top month contribution compared to the full scan
  due to the exit condition.",,ppigazzini,2023-04-23 09:11:38,,server/utils/delta_update_users.py,,,,,True

Commit,47ea3d29144d280cafd8b2322c9fe76b6d45e215,"More robust wake up from sleep.

I occasionally still observe duplicate notifications on ipad after
wake up. I think the reason is that one tab may sleep before a
fetch and another thread may sleep during the ""async_sleep(1500)"".
This results in a race.

We catch this by checking the actual time slept. If it is > 90s
then we cancel the fetch.

One would like to reduce the 90s but this would be defeated by the
fact that timers on Chrome fire only once per minute in inactive
tabs.

There is also some nice refactoring. The function async_sleep
can now be used as

let t = await async_sleep(delay_ms);

where t is the amount of time (in ms) that is actually slept.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2023-05-09 07:14:08,,"server/fishtest/static/js/application.js,server/fishtest/static/js/notifications.js",,,,,True

Several workers in the last month between 30 and 32 threads have fallen afoul of the well-established cutechess bugs in many-threaded contexts. Altho most such workers run fine, we currently have no server-side filtering of garbage results, nor any worker-side workaround, so this is the best we've got. Update it now to reduce future garbage with the least current effort.

As stated, most workers in the 29-32 thread run fine, but those that don't are a significant problem. To the best of my knowledge, all workers at 28 or less have run fine so far.

Try pre-including worker cores in cores/itp priority estimate

At present, STC tasks appear to systematically have higher cores/itp
than LTC tasks. If this is due to low workers-per-test granularity
issues, this is the fix.

Tweak itp assignment: average oldcores+newcores, but always at least one worker

Per the code comment:
Tests with low itp/workers-per-test can cause granularity issues. If
we simply use oldcores-per-itp, then low-core tests will be overweighted
when they're assigned large workers. If we simply use newcores-per-itp,
then low-core tests will be underweighted when they're *not* assigned
large workers. Split the difference by splitting the difference, and
also ensuring at least one worker at all times.

Commit,89c37044a5ad72bca1042d974811a4ce2eb70660,"Reduce latency of LTC relative to STC

Adjust the TC power law exponent to make base LTC TP of 4x STC TP,
with the goal of reducing LTC latency to only 1.5x STC latency.

With the recent of busyness of fishtest (a good thing IMO), the
current LTC latency of sqrt(6) ~ 2.5x is making for painfully long
feedback time, potentially causing authors to submit more
later-unnecessary STC tests rather than wait for LTC results. The
latency is actually more than 2.5x on average since LTC elo bounds
are higher as well, requiring more games at the same elo performance
(on average).

This adjustment reduces LTC base latency from 2.5 to 1.5, which
should hopefully reduce the number of red-herring STC submissions
as the test result feedback loop tightens up.

I also tweaked the LLR bonus TP, reducing it slightly on both ends,
but I'm not nearly as attached to this as to the exponent change.
(1.37/0.63 new max/min vs old max/min 1.59/0.41)

An easy way to enable to avoid duplicate entries is to
look up the network in the DB just before adding the entry.

This PR speed up the upload process and reduces possible race conditions
checking for duplicate files on the file server as well, raising
the appropriate HTTP errors if necessary.

Other changes:
 - use a fixed path for the POST (usually the {id} is used in PUT and
   DELETE)
 - use a multipart form POST to upload the network.

Commit,1ecf68f9dfd86cf85ba8ca2a471eeb38a2e31406,"Compute sri hashes of worker files and compare with master.

The sri hashes of the current worker files are stored in a
file ""sri.txt"". This file is updated each time the worker
runs, and it can also be updated manually with

python worker.py --only_config

CI is used to enforce that the file sri.txt matches the worker files
during pushes or pull requests.

The worker will also download the master sri.txt (currently not existing)

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glinscott/fishtest/master/worker/sri.txt

and check if the hashes in that file coincide with the sri hashes
of the current worker. If not then a message is printed on the terminal.
A tainted worker is not stopped but the flag worker_info['modified'] is
set to True. In a subsequent PR the server will use this information
in the event log messages (for debugging purposes).

In order to fix the race condition between the update of the master
worker on GitHub and the update of the Fishtest server (which pulls its
code from GitHub), the file sri.txt contains the version number of the
worker. We ignore the master sri.txt if its version is higher

Currently the algorithm for the default uuid_prefix uses the MAC
address. But the MAC address is unstable on modern OSes. Moreover
uuid.getnode() seems to be buggy on a number of systems and simply
returns a random number. This needs ugly and fragile workarounds.

The new algorithm uses:

1) the machine_id (a uuid generated during system install);
2) the absolute path of the worker;
3) a random seed which is saved in the config file.

This algorithm can be defeated by cloning a cloud instance with
an installed worker.

This seems like a niche case. But if it turns out that it does happen
then we can work around it by detecting the resulting duplicate
prefix and generating a new seed.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2022-06-11 05:03:15,,worker/worker.py,,,,,True

CMI cmdlets require powershell 3.0 or later, so a Windows 7 user
may need to update to a newer powershell version.

The legacy VMI cmdlets were dropped with powershell 6.0, so they are not
a viable solution to keep compatibility with old (and EOL) Windows versions.

Commit,e145a5d693332ee59074a4b3402bc53209640270,"Fix formula for disabling ""Next"" button in pager.

I think the format of the pager has changed over
the years. As a result the code for disabling
the Next button is no longer correct.

In this PR the Next button is disabled when

page_idx>=(num_finished_runs - 1) // page_size

where page_idx=<current page no>-1.

Examples:

num_finished_runs=75, page_size=25

We have 3 full pages. So Next should be disabled if the current
page number is 3. I.e. if page_idx=2. This is what the
formula gives.

num_finished_runs=76, page_size=25

Now we have 4 pages, the last one containing 1 run. So Next
should be disabled when page_idx=3, which is again what the formula gives.

Note:

Since we currently do not exclude deleted runs from our
queries, but filter them out later instead, it is theoretically
possible to have empty pages. This is quite unlikely however since
deleted runs are very rare.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2022-01-14 09:58:09,,server/fishtest/views.py,,,,,True

When the probability of double wins/losses is low then
normalized Elo may be approximated as

nElo = sqrt(2)*Elo/sqrt(1-d)

Commit,8cc3b507d49513234005d4435d9767598dbf947c,"Some tweaks around option handling.

1) This PR started by trying to fix.

https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/issues/1184

It turned that there are fundamental issues with the
semantics of --use_all_cores. So it was decided
to deprecate --use_all_cores and to introduce
--concurrency max as a clearly defined substitute for
--use_all_cores True.

Some backward compatibility is temporarily retained, but
--use_all_cores will be removed in the future to simplify
the worker code.

2) We now strictly validate config file entries and command
line parameters.

In particular we make sure that in the options object returned by
setup_parameters() all attributes have the expected type. This
makes the downstream code simpler.

3) We switch from optparse to argparse. optparse is deprecated.

4) We now check, at the startup of the worker, that the
password, supplied via the config file or on the command line,
is correct. If it is not then we present a password dialog.

This validation step is skipped when the flag --no_validation is
present on the command line. In combination with --only_config
this is useful when there is no network access.

5) --only_config is now a flag. In contrast --fleet remains
a boolean since all three possibilities (True/False of omitted)
are meaningful.

More generic error handling in api.py.
In particular the error message will
now always include the api that caused it.

The worker now uses send_api_post_request()
for all POST api requests.

A comment in api.py about fishtest instances.

Adapt test_api.py to dynamic tasks.

HTTPUnauthorized exception when stop_run fails.

Make the beat api the same as the other apis.

Create an ""info"" field in api when the worker tries to
do something with an inactive task.

Make the heartbeat thread a daemon thread.

Get rid of the many ""Error from remote"" messages in the worker.
Print the error message in send_api_post_request() instead.
As a bonus we also print info messages now.

Only check username/password for /api/request_version.
By being less strict here we can be more strict elsewhere since
the worker will upgrade.

Make upload_pgn a bit more robust.

We do the validation when parsing the arguments. For example
self.task_id() will throw a HTTPBadRequest() exception if it
does not succeed in returning a task_id corresponding to an
existing task. So downstream code may assume that a task_id
argument is valid.

We do this when starting the worker (which is racy) and also
(as a fallback) before requesting a new task
(in that case we also check that the content of the lock file
is different from the current pid).",,Michel Van den Bergh,2021-10-26 20:36:57,,worker/worker.py,,,,,True

always return 1 except when using --only_config

is detected. It replaces a former call to worker_exit().

conditions.

Make the default cpu_count a bit adaptive (but
keep the maximum 3).

Refactor adjust_tc.

Commit,a4ccf1b99958bf5123710c11cf5029a89896adcc,"Bug fix for purges with crashes and time losses.

The new purging logic purges workers (based on their residuals), not tasks.
So the current code which sets the residual to 8 for a task with several
crashes has no effect anymore (since it does not change the residual of the worker).

The implemented solution is to start purge_run() with a loop which filters
tasks with crashes and time losses, and then to compute the worker
based residuals (since these will be affected by the preliminary filtering).

Commit,4c0987966e0e9f09d7c73f632b2500de0d8114ba,"Refactor purging logic and overhaul the residuals computation.

The computation of bad_workers is now done inside purge_run(),
where it logically belongs.

As a side effect of the refactoring it is now easy to have
different purging criteria for auto purging and manual purging.

As a proof of concept we have set the purging criteria for
manual purging to p=0.01 and residual=4.5, whereas for auto purging
(disabled by default) we have set them to p=0.001 and residual=7.0.

We also use a different logic for computing residuals because the
previous residuals (defined as the maximum of the absolute values
of the Pearson adjusted residuals in a row) have an unknown distribution.
Now we compute (conceptually) for every row in the chi2 table the
chi2 value of the 2x3 table obtained by that row and the sum of
the other rows. This chi2 value follows a chi2 distribution with
two degrees of freedom (under the null hypothesis that the workers are
homogeneous). To keep some compatibility with the previous
residuals, we convert the chi2 value to a standard normal
value.

To give an indication of the severity of a residual, Fishtest
uses a coloring scheme. However this coloring scheme was created
when far fewer workers were active. These days most of the
yellow and red residuals are just the result of statistical
fluctuations and as a result nobody pays any attention to them.

In this PR we update the coloring scheme. More precisely we color
residuals according to the p=0.05 and p=0.01 thresholds, but
using the Bonferroni correction, which divides these p-values
by the number of workers.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2021-09-26 07:19:00,,"server/fishtest/rundb.py,server/fishtest/util.py,server/fishtest/views.py",,,,,True

Commit,a990775aa2121316187eabb5147253837768c49c,"Get rid of worker_key altogether.

This should be a non functional conceptual simplification.

The worker key tries to solve two unrelated problems:

(1) Long ago workers did not have to a unique key, so a substitute
has to be provided for the chi2 test.

(2) The unique key is not suitable for displaying, and perhaps should
be kept secret as well. So the worker key is displayed instead.

Now we simply provide two functions

unique_key(worker_info)
worker_name(worker_info)

corresponding to (1,2).",,Michel Van den Bergh,2021-09-17 09:00:15,,"server/fishtest/api.py,server/fishtest/rundb.py,server/fishtest/templates/tests_view.mak,server/fishtest/util.py",,,,,True

Bugfix: the current code (like the old code) may not pick
up changes of run[""cores""] due to finished tasks.

More precisely: if a cached version of task_runs is not sorted
at the beginning of request_task() its first entry may be a run
which does not have the lowest value of run[""cores""]/run[""itp""]
because it may be that since the last call to request_task()

Commit,29983d0349f1879fd937ed92009ce8429b496faf,"Generate tasks dynamically.

We start with an empty task list and create new tasks as needed.

Detailed changes:

- Refactor ""update_task"".

The main change is that we do not inspect the task list to see
if a test is finished.

- Bug fix

Make task[""active""]=False after a broken update.
I think this fixes a bug in the current Fishtest code.

- Try to create 60 min tasks using ""estimate_game_duration"",
""concurrency"" and ""threads"".

The 60 min is configurable by the variable self.task_duration in
rundb.py. Currently its value is 3600.

- Make sure that the task_size is not zero for very long TC.

- Filter workers participating in the chi2 test.

We filter out the workers that have cells with expected
frequencies <=5. This is the recommended practice.

With the current UHO book this means that at LTC
a worker should contribute around 50 games to make the
cut.

Currently the chi2 test assumes that the games in a task are independently
drawn from a trinomial distribution. This assumption is no longer
valid for an unbalanced book. This is very visible from the p-values
which are often > 99%. Under the null hypothesis p-values should be
uniformly distributed.

the chi2 test to be valid, we coalesce them with the wd and ld frequencies.

Commit,c200c3fabd0fc7d66eda3d5df28aa7fde6e7806c,"Decrease base nps

The recently added new net arch introduced a slowdown. On my system it is 6.8% slower. In the commit it is said to be 15% to 20% slower. I guess this could vary quite a lot between different CPU instruction sets. For now I decreased base_nps by 10% but there are arguments to be made to change it less/more depending if we change on most commonly supported instruction set on fishtest, slowest arch or fastest arch etc.
I hope @vondele and @snicolet have recommendations on how to deal with this matter.

The options `-rounds str(int(games_to_play / 2)) -games 2` was introduced
to mute a cutechess-cli warning.
In fishtest the rounding works because the pentanomial code updates the result
with game pairs, so an unfinished run (after a worker stop) has an even number
of games_to_play.
Use the safer `-games str(int(games_to_play))` option that mutes the warning
and works also with an odd number of games_to_play.

New bounds for STC and LTC tests in fishtest.

The main change is that the new bounds will make LTC tests quite easier to pass Elo-wise.
We have to shrink the intervals to keep good precision, so the total cost will be about three
times longer runs in the worst case.

Commit,c56d8fff957a39b76eaec192860381e55a986c8b,"List SPRT bounds in ""normalized Elo"" on the raw stats page.

Normalized Elo is inversely proportional
to the square root of the number of games
it takes on average to detect a given strength
difference with a given level of significance.

In case of a perfectly balanced book and
small Elo differences normalized Elo is
approximately equal to

logistic_elo/sqrt(1-draw_ratio)

In other words if the draw ratio is zero,
the book is perfectly balanced
and Elo differences are small then
normalized Elo and logistic Elo coincide.

The theory behind normalized Elo is discussed here

http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Fishtest/normalized_elo.pdf

Compared to loc. cit. we have settled on using
an additional normalization factor

800/log(10)=347.43558552260146

which has the effect that normalized Elo and logistic Elo
are easier to compare (as explained above).

We also convert the former sensitivity field to normalized Elo.

Hopefully using this conversion the field will become
easier to interpret.

The purpose of the sensitivity field is to compare opening books.
The opening book influences both Elo and the draw ratio. By expressing
the result of a test in normalized Elo one can compare different
books.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2020-12-19 19:08:13,,server/fishtest/templates/tests_stats.mak,,,,,True

This PR adds a checkbox to the ""New Test"" form. Checking this option
will rewrite the hyperparameters furnished by the tuning branch in
such a way that the SPSA tune will finish within 0.5 Elo from the optimum
(with 95% probability) assuming the function 'parameters->Elo'
is quadratic and varies 2 Elo per parameter over each specified
parameter interval. The hyperparameters are relatively conservative
and their performance will degrade gracefully if the actual variation
is different.  The theoretical basis for choosing the hyperparameters is
given in this document

The formulas can be checked by simulation which is done here

https://github.com/vdbergh/spsa_simul

The worker code is serial and hence in principle

This makes the idea of adding new types of tests
rather unattractive.

up some of the worker code.

equivalent to version 75

- The global variable old_stats is eliminated. The fact
that such a global variable exists needlessly complicates the
logic of the worker code.

- Trinomial and pentanomial frequencies are

In principle batch_size is the number of games that have to be
completed by the worker before an update is sent to the server.
However for sprt and numgames tests it is actually twice the
number of completed game pairs.

batch_size for sprt is communicated by the server. The reason
is that for the sprt algorithm to be theoretically correct all
workers have to use the same batch size.

For other tests batch_size is currently set by the worker to twice the
number of games it is capable of running concurrently.

This is equal to the number of cores reserved for the worker,
divided by the number of threads used by the engines.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2020-04-22 10:46:44,,worker/games.py,,,,,True

- Add indexes to flag and user caches for faster lookups and lower CPU
- IP lookups expire after 7 days using a MongoDB TTL index
- create_indexes.py now takes a list of collection names as arguments

  - for each collection name given, it drops then creates indexes on it

Strictly speaking, the index on IP in flag_cache should be a unique index,
but practically a non-unique index avoids race conditions since there's a
delay between the lookup and inserting a new document, and documents in
this collection auto-expire anyways.

Using skip for mongodb collections is inefficient for iterating through
large collections. It's better to use range queries on an indexed field.

See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/#using-range-queries

This will only result in a significant speedup when iterating through a

this should improve the pending hours estimate, by reflecting current average games / test, and not counting tests run so far for sprt tests.
More accurately estimating the remaining number of games for a running sprt test is not obvious.

move this estimate away from the pending tests line, to the top status line, since this is an estimate of all tests, related to the current estimated fishtest performance.

Commit,4e4ab77abea63f45f71b042f4ff2b146ad0937dd,"Better overshoot correction.

The theoretical properties of an SPRT are established under the
assumption that updates are continuous.

To have accurate agreement with the predictions, when the updates are
discrete, one has to estimate the expected ""overshoot"" and terminate
the SPRT a bit early, accordingly.  Unfortunately, to the best of our
knowledge, overshoot estimation is (surprisingly) computationally expensive.

Moreover in the case of a GSPRT there is the added complication of
unknown parameters and these have to be continuously estimated from
the sample. This more or less means that the expected overshoot
estimation has to be performed after every update, which is
prohibitively expensive (IMHO, doing it only when we are ""close"" to
one of the boundaries would lead to messy and possibly fragile code).

A theoretical formula for the expected overshoot is: Siegmund -
Sequential Analysis - Corollary 8.33. Like other such formulas, it is
difficult to evaluate theoretically, but the result can be very easily
estimated, with only a few lines of code, from the ongoing test itself.
This ""dynamic overshoot estimation"" is implemented in this commit.

That this works very well can be verified by simulation. A multi-threaded
simulator written in C can be found here.

https://github.com/vdbergh/simul

Example:

$ ./simul --elo0 0 --elo1 10 --elo 0

yields

...
sims=20001904 pass=0.050322[0.050175,0.050469] ...
...

whereas

$ ./simul --elo0 0 --elo1 10 --elo 0 --noovcor

yields

...
sims=20000943 pass=0.048530[0.048385,0.048674] ...
...

(the confidence interval is 3 sigma).

Obviously the version with overshoot correction is much more accurate.

Currently Fishtest uses an approximate formula for overshoot
correction which is actually not even asymptotically correct, although
it works well for small Elo differences. However for larger Elo
differences it starts to break down. This is undesirable as people may
copy the Fishtest code and apply it in a different context.

In the implementation the SPRT() function in stat_util.py now takes an
sprt dictionary as argument. This dictionary may optionally contain a
subdictionary with dynamic overshoot data which is updated in-place.
It is assumed that SPRT() is called after each finished game (trinomial)
or game pair (pentanomial). But calling SPRT() multiple times with
the same parameters is safe and skipped updates are also handled sensibly.
After a purge the overshoot data is deleted. Deleting the overshoot data
is always safe as it simply means that the test is carried out with error
probabilities that are slightly smaller than the assigned ones.

The actual overshoot estimates can be found on the raw statistics
page. Note that the estimate corresponding to the test outcome (H0 or H1)
is typically the most accurate.",,Michel Van den Bergh,2020-02-08 05:15:50,,"fishtest/fishtest/rundb.py,fishtest/fishtest/stats/LLRcalc.py,fishtest/fishtest/stats/stat_util.py,fishtest/fishtest/templates/tests_stats.mak,fishtest/fishtest/views.py",,,,,True

When a test is stopped and restarted (by a modify) this
can cause many runs (30 days period) to be counted twice.
This happens only when the restarted test was the only new
finished test at the last execution of this script.
When the test is restarted before the script is executed
then there is also no error condition.

This can be fixed by storing also all older run-ids,
with a small performance impact (bigger MongoDb table).

Note that tasks in the restarted test are counted twice
when the error condition happens. This should be very rare.",,Tom Vijlbrief,2019-10-17 06:03:14,,fishtest/utils/delta_update_users.py,,,,,True

Commit,dc75bcb144d6b58e4395a1b46b7ca1623f9683a8,"Change SPRT parameters for standard test

Following the discussion here https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/issues/1859, we aim at

    Improve precision, i.e. discard zero or negative patches and accept positive ones with higher margin

    Manage resource consumption.

After various simulations, here are results for different sets of SPRT parameters:

| Limits | [0,5] + [0,5]  | [0.5, 4.5] + [0,3.5] | [1,4] + [0,3]  | [0.5, 4] + [0, 3] | [0.5, 4] + [0, 3.5] | [0.4, 4.4] + [0, 3.2] |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0 ELO pass prob | 0.0025 | 0.00123 | 0.00036 | 0.0011 | 0.0011 | 0.0014 |
| 1 ELO pass prob | 0.0744 | 0.1002 | 0.0805 | 0.1451 | 0.1183 | 0.1276 |
| +1 ELO rejectance ratio | 0.8201 | 0.7547 | 0.7625 | 0.6718 | 0.7049 | 0.7137 |
| +1.5 ELO rejectance ratio | 0.6310 | 0.5160 | 0.4865 | 0.3968 | 0.4249 | 0.4679 |
| +2 ELO rejectance ratio | 0.3936| 0.2709 | 0.2026 | 0.1700 | 0.1819 | 0.2374 |
| total ELO gain ratio | 1.0 | 1.3192 | 1.2373 | 1.7596 | 1.5664 | 1.5523 |
| -0 ELO acceptance ratio | 2.5 e-04 | 9.1e-05 | 2.2e-0.5 | 1.0 e-04 |  7.77 e-05 | 1.0 e-04 |
| Avg. STC cost | 18431 | 24456 | 34574 | 30936 | 30936 | 25110 |
| Avg. STC + LTC Cost | 27931 | 38039 | 45286 | 50604 | 46093 | 42990 |

From the table above, there is consensus that [0.5, 4.5] + [0, 3.5] pair is the best balance between improved sensitivity and resource consumption.

This patch makes the above parameters the default.

Print an error message and pass the execution if the kill of the process fails.
The kill of the process is used as safety measure against a hanging process.
At the moment all the running processes seems to run and close fine,

With a WSL worker that run a SPSA test when the kill fails is raised
an exception that stops the execution for some seconds slowing the test.

prior to this patch, spsa boudnary treatment has the following two
properties:
* samples on either side of the iterate are clipped independently,
  meaning the sampling distribution is not symmetric about the current
  parameter.
* After clipping, it's possible to have a value exactly at the boundary.

This is bad because spsa interprets a draw as ""do nothing"", meaning
parameters are not updated.  but that only makes sense if the present
parameters are the average of the parameters tried in the test, which is
not the clase with the old clipping.

The second point is bad if one believes the first point is bad (causes
excessive asymmetry).

So this patch introduces clipping which is always symmetric.  It is
moreover cautious to not move all the way to the boundary when doing
this update.",,Werner Fenchel,2016-06-11 20:18:54,,"fishtest/fishtest/rundb.py,fishtest/fishtest/templates/tests_run.mak,fishtest/fishtest/views.py",,,,,True

Commit,44cf23081831e0ae4a2f2780864f5bf3ab26608e,"fix base_nps in SMP tests with HT

In verify_signature 'concurrency' was wrongly set to 'games_concurrency' instead of 'games_concurrency * threads'

In verify_signature() are started 2 instance of the engine:
- the first one with 'go infinite' and number of threads 'concurrency - 1': in order to load the CPU
- the second one with 'bench' and one thread: in order to compute bench signature and bench nps

In this way:
1. worker with virtual cores are rated correctly in SMP tests
2. worker without virtual cores are rated with the correct setting for TurboBoost (minor effect)

Tested with my worker (4-cores with HT)

With 'concurrency = 3', in all tests, my worker is rated @ 2.24 Mnps

With 'concurrency = 7'
  a. in 1-thread tests, the worker is rated @ 1.40 Mnps (TC scaled as with 7 slow cores)
  b. in 7-threads tests, the worker is rated @ 1.40 Mnps (TC scaled as with 7 slow cores)

Before the fix, with 'concurrency = 7' 
  c. in 7-threads tests, the worker was rated @ 2.24 Mnps (TC scaled as with 7 fast cores, wrong!)",,ppigazzini,2015-11-08 19:23:08,,worker/games.py,,,,,True

Commit,39b29eb7ac2d743b08bfe9f9f26019ac3b16dd48,"Feed a random seed to cutechess.

Cutechess presently uses the current time, in seconds, to seed its RNG.
This makes it very easy for various machines in fishtest to choose the
same random seed on the same workload, particularly when a large number
of machines join a machine pool for a specific test.

The fix here is to pass a random integer to cutechess via the ""-srand""
option.  A platform-independent seed is chosen using os.urandom(),
which raises an exception if a randomness source is unavailable.

Cutechess only uses 32 bits of random state (a ""quint32""), and the
parser for -srand requires an unsigned integer (although the
Mersenne::initialize routine just takes an int), so the routine here
generates an unsigned integer.

Commit,e3af2a107f7b19063db1a2f8bb94c03490041c04,"Restore LTC at 60 seconds

The sensible point of a LTC game is the average search depth (specially at midgame) not the average game duration.

Scalability issue are more and more important and the number of tests that pass STC and fail LTC is sensible (even now with SPRT[0,5] for both cases). This means that we really want to test a patch at a good average search depth rate. Ideally we want an even higher value of LTC, but given our current resoruces 60 seconds is an acceptable compromise.

This patch restores average search depth and has the draw back of increasing testing time by 40 secs on average. This is more then acceptable IMO considering the current rate of tests that fail LTC after STC (scalability sensible) and the fact that only few tests reach LTC, so total testing time is not so impacted.",,Marco Costalba,2015-10-17 05:42:41,,fishtest/fishtest/templates/tests_run.mak,,,,,True

Without that we cannot test time management patches correctly, because each
worker uses a different increment/base ratio.

This problem is also known to cause chi-square to fail for tcs where the
increment is not small respective to the base, like 5+0.05 for example
(for the same reason).

Now with C++11 std::chrono, SF uses a sub millisecond precision on every
platform. The only constraint is that the Timer thread only checks for
time every 5 msec, but that's still 10x less than our 50msec increment,
so no risk to go below that.",,lucasart,2015-04-18 04:00:37,,worker/games.py,,,,,True

These games came from GM games that Norm Pollock collected and shares at
his website (the same games that Martin used to make the TCEC book used
in stage 1). I used some of the top engines to filter out positions that
may be too unbalanced. The final position of each truncated game is unique,
so that it is a source of 48,491 unique starting positions. Also, I used
some of the top engines to filter out positions that may be too unbalanced.

After a task is finished the worker always diconnects
from the host.

This has the effect to correctly catch CTRL+C under windows,
that currently simply quits worker.py without rising any
exception and so leaving a stale machine on host.

But in general terms it is also IMHO a better way to handle
normal task processing where we each job transaction become

In particulary we can have 2 cases:

1) User app (like a worker task) runs locally on the same

2) User app runs on another machine and acceses the host

In the first case there is nothing to do, in the second case
user shall setup a ssh connection with port forwarding, see
README for details.
